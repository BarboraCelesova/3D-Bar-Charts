 I wanted to see if I could use Three.js and Greensock to make dynamic, animated bar graphs that could potentially be used in conjunction with data pulled from sources such as XML. Whilst I didn't get as far as pulling in the data, it'd be no challenge to replace the randomised values of each bar with dynamic data.
